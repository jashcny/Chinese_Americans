				<h2>Anti-Chinese Movement</h2>
				<p>
					In the 1870s, the depressed economy deepened Americans’ resentment of Chinese people, especially for those states where the Chinese were clustered, like California. Their resentments first appeared by distorting Chinese characters in poems, cartoons, movies and newspapers, but later anti-Chinese movement rose to violence, setting fires and shooting Chinese people in Chinatowns. The growing hostility led to a mass exodus of Chinese from California; some of them returned to China while others who could not afford passage moved to states like Illinois and Ohio.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="05/06/1882">
				<h2>The Chinese Exclusion Act</h2>
				<p>
					In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was enacted, which restricted Chinese immigration. It also prohibited them from reentering if they left the United States. In order to prevent Chinese people from establishing roots in the U.S., Chinese were not allowed to bring their families to America, which created a male bachelor society.

				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="12/07/1941">
				<h2>World War II</h2>
				<p>
					The turning point of Americans’ attitude toward the Chinese happened when China became an ally of the United States during World War II. About 15,000 to 20,000 Chinese Americans joined the US Army, fighting for their ancestral homeland, their honor and their loyalty to the United States.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="12/28/1945">
				<h2>The War Brides Act</h2>
				<p>
					In 1945, the US published the War Brides Act, which allowed ethnic Chinese veterans to marry in China and bring their wives to America. The new arrivals and new births during 1940s increased the population of Chinese Americans sharply, which jumped from 77,000 to 117,000 in the United States.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="12/07/1949">
				<h2>Chinese Intellectuals</h2>
				<p>
					After World War II, the ruling Nationalist government lost its power in mainland China during the five year Civil War and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. At the same time, nearly 5,000 Chinese intellectuals escaped from China and built new lives in the United States. However, the development of the atomic bomb in China and the Korean War brought back the anti-Chinese movement, which affected Chinese Americans financially and physically. Most Chinese intellectuals lived under surveillance, suspected of being Communists by the FBI. Meanwhile, the United States prohibited all remittance to mainland China.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="01/01/1960">
				<h2>Taiwanese Americans</h2>
				<p>
					With America’s  comprehensive support to the Nationalist government and its huge investment in the realms of science and technology, thousands of Taiwanese students pursuing high-tech  fields came to the United States with full scholarships in the 1960s. Nevertheless, these students’ lives in America were not easy; they not only had to financially help their families in Taiwan, but they were also watched by spies from Nationalists, fearing they would be assimilated by the Communists.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="01/01/1970">
				<h2>Study-abroad Fever</h2>
				<p>
					Thanks to the Reform and Opening up policy, as well as the resuming diplomatic relations between China and the United States from 1970s to 1980s, almost 80,000 scholars traveled from Mainland China to the U.S., which constituted the largest wave of Chinese intellectuals in history. Later, the whole country formed a “study-abroad fever”. In addition, the US government sets no limits for the number of Chinese tourists. In the 1980s, the racial discrimination gradually reflected in education after news reported that ethnic Chinese students concentrated on top Universities in the United States. Prestigious universities started to set a higher threshold and reduced the admission rate specifically for Chinese Americans, American born Chinese usually rejected by their dream school even their academic performance were more qualified than their counterparts.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="01/01/1990">
				<h2>Hong Kong Refugees</h2>
				<p>
					The decade of 1990s spotlighted on immigrants from Taiwan and Hong Kong. In order to escape uncertain life after the transfer of government over Hong Kong, many Hong Kong refugees moved their families to the United States but maintained their business in Hong Kong. On the other side, rich Taiwanese began to send their children and shift their wealth to the United States, fearing the pro-Taiwan independence groups would trigger a war against mainland China. Under this circumstance, the words “astronaut” and “Parachute ” were perfectly represented the lifestyle of Hong Kong fathers and Taiwan Children.

		<p>The easiest data recording immigration population by homeland security was 1820s, when only three Chinese obtaining lawful permanent resident status. From the animation story and the history timeline we can clearly find out that each wave of immigration triggered by an important history event, especially for the region of Hong Kong and Taiwan. The biggest rise in the population of Chinese Americans took place between the 1970s and early 1990s. Unlike the early immigrants, most of them are full of adventure and highly educated. Their expectations of the United States more than a place to escape civil wars and poverty but a brilliant future in the academic fields and workforce. However, with the rise of Chinese economy and the continually changing of immigration policy, the determination of staying in the United State wasn’t stronger as before.</p>

	The reasons for early Chinese immgrants to leave their country was to seek a better life for their families. Considering the restrictions of immigrantion policies and personal economy, most of Chinese laborers were unable
	to bring their families members to the United States.In order to ensure  survival of the family line and receive monthly remittance, parents would forced their young sons into marriage and gave birth to next generations before they left China.
	In Chinese conventional ideology, every member should spare no efforts to countribute the development of whole family. Generations by generations, immigrants are accustomed to support their relatives in the montherland no matter how close is their relationship.</p>

<section id="final">
<h2>History & Future</h2>
<p>The immigration story of Chinese Americans began from an eagerness of getting rid of poverty in California’s Golden Mountain. In general, it is not a comedy, the first-generation immigrants went through a life full of struggle, sadness, and desperation no matter whether they became rich at last. Most of them came to the United States with a  idea that they would brought large amounts of money and went back home soon. In certain areas, men were cheated as cheap labor while women were sold as prostitutes. The most miserable memory for Chinese laborers would be the the experience of building the transcontinental railroad. At that time, they had to work twelve-hour shifts six days a week. White laborers could be paid 35 dollars a month and board, while Chinese laborers were forced to do the riskiest work while getting only 30 dollars pay and boarding themselves. In addition, they went through two of the worst winters in American history and used nitroglycerin to explode the granite in order to lay tracks. Because of this, nearly one in ten Chinese labors perished during the construction of the railroad.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the Chinese decedents were instilled with minds that only diligent study and  industrious work could pave the way to a successful life. Even after they emigrated to a new country, Chinese Americans were kept out of politics. Under this circumstance, most of them were accustomed to keeping silence and tolerance in front of unfair treatment. Years by years, the Chinese Americans were regarded as third class citizens in american society.</p>
<p>The 2016 U.S. president election saw a great change among Chinese-Americans. People who have never cared for politics started to gather in chinatowns and voted for Donald Trump. This may seem ridiculous at the first glance because Trump is racist. Nevertheless, this is an reasonable behavior on their side. The most important issue in a typical Chinese family is education, nothing could be more than their children’s education rights. Although Chinese students excel in high school, merely part of them have opportunities to obtain admission of their dream schools because of the affirmative action. Therefore, parents believe their children will have a bright future if Trump takes power and ends the affirmative action.</p>
<p>Now, Donald Trump became the U.S. president, but no one know what will really happen in the future. For Chinese H1B visa seekers, this may not be a good news.</p>
